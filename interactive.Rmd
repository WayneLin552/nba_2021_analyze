# Interactive component
In this part, we use two interactive lollipop charts to visualize different statistics of NBA teams in regular season and playoff. In the charts,teams are ordered based on their winning percentage, and we use light blue dots to represent teams from western conference while dark blue represents eastern conference. 

There are 8 statistics to choose from: field goals made(FGM), 3 point field goals made(3PM), free throws made(FTM), assists(AST), offensive rebounds(OREB), defensive rebounds(DREB), blocks(BLK) and steals(STL). One can use the buttons at the top to select an interested statistics and see the change.
