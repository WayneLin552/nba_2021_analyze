[["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic NBA is one of the most famous sports leagues in the world. In this final project, we will focus on data analysis of NBA regular season and playoffs in season 2021-22. In regular season, we will analyze each team’s performance base on conference. Performance will include: field goals made(FGM), 3 point field goals made(3PM), free throws made(FTM), assists(AST), offensive rebounds(OREB), defensive rebounds(DREB), blocks(BLK) and steals(STL). Among these features, FGM, 3PM, FTM, AST and OREB are categorized to be offensive statistics since they are related to a team’s offensive performance. DREB, BLK and STL are considered as defensive statistics since they reveal the defense level of a team. We will use some visualization techniques to check different conference’s styles based on these statistics and determine if those styles significantly influence each team’s victory rate. In playoffs, firstly, we will do similar analyze like regular season. Then we will discuss why those teams perform better than those that can not enter the playoffs. Finally, we will analyze the teams played in NBA finals in 2021, to see their performance in every round. 2.2 Data availability In this *link, NBA official website has clearly explained how they collected and distributed those data.
